===================================================

The data structures of ``ParticleSet`` and its children, ``ParticleSnapshot``
(for frames) and ``Trajectory`` (for trajectories) are found in the module
``flowtracks.trajectory``. Also in the modules are some functions to  create
and manipulate these structures. This page provides a reference for the content
